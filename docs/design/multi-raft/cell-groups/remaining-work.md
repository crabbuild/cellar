# Remaining cell-group work and priorities

Purpose: Prioritize the remaining cell-group MVP, merge gates and full architecture deliverables.

PR [#160](https://github.com/crabbuild/cellar/pull/160) contains the shared runtime
and the accepted public SQL cutover. This ordering preserves the full
CG-01–16 objective in [tasks.json](tasks.json), [design](design.md) and
[qualification](qualification.md). See [progress](progress.md) for exact source
and validation boundaries and [handoff](handoff.md) for executor context.

## Current boundary

CG-01–08 passed their recorded acceptance gates. Shared group owners,
cell-specific SQLite histories/receipts/effects/versions, complete checkpoints,
archives/reclamation and fenced fresh-history recovery have scoped coverage.
Managed startup, directory refresh, membership send fences, capacity admission,
peer/S3 replacement, stop/return/resume and retained initial/joined restart pass
component cases. Automatic S3 voter recovery reaches terminal removal while
retaining the obsolete engine and disk. Production platform fencing and the complete fault matrix remain in CG-13–16.

An earlier eleven-target campaign recorded 308 passes, 2 failures and 39
explicit skips. Subsequent fixes and qualification retain their own source
records. At `84942c4e`, all ten CG-07 acceptance commands passed, including
the five exact public cases and strict all-target Clippy. The managed lifecycle
passed both real RustFS image modes. The constrained Linux campaign also
passed both modes with failed-voter replacement. Full release qualification
remains in CG-14–16.

The request case qualifies follower writes, explicit namespace/process grant and
revocation, remote minimum-version/linearizable reads, forwarded S3 acknowledgement,
joined leader-stop failover, retained restart/deduplication and quorum-loss refusals
in both image forms. The public counter requires all six native/Axum addresses to
serve original retry receipts before and after retained restart. Current-source
RustFS results and all exact source/binary limits are recorded in
[progress](progress.md). Earlier disk-erasure and other checkpoints retain their
recorded sources and are not relabeled as this campaign.

Ingress without a local replica can serve reads and writes through trusted group
routes. SDK command forwarding retains the original owner and deadline and
requires namespace write permission. Local SQL, effect and archive proof remain
distinct from authenticated remote output. The managed acceptance exercises
native and Axum ingress with zero local groups. SDK enrollment now uses that
path and preserves the exact creation record at both durability minima.
A configured managed router now refreshes its voter routes after a replacement.
The native and real RustFS cases cover the retired route, joined-voter reads,
original receipt replay and a fresh quorum write. Cold return after all birth
voters are replaced and stopped passes the focused native and RustFS cases.
The public SDK provisions a declared managed standby and reserves, publishes
and confirms its first full-range group. The CLI and admin API admit capacity
and initialize the rooted archive. The managed SQL daemon discovers the group
and waits for the exact archive and fresh quorum before opening application
ingress. At `cd1d8315`, the native process gate and constrained Linux RustFS
gate passed in both image formats. The latter uses separate voter containers
and disks in one VM with fixture capacity. It covers native and Axum reads and
writes, voter SIGKILL, receipt replay, retained restart and quorum-loss refusal.
Production capacity admission, interrupted-operation schedules and sustained
load qualification remain open.

The managed native and real RustFS request cases now cover foreign cluster,
namespace and cell histories through both HTTP hosts, and foreign fleet,
namespace and physical group requests through the admin API. Valid retries
preserve the original receipt after those refusals. The named public authority
and occupancy-one cases pass their recorded native scope.

CG-09 through CG-15 are in progress. CG-16 is pending the combined
release gate. Individual checkpoints cover operator-driven split and merge,
placement recommendations, fenced parking and wake, managed recovery and
parts of the qualification matrix. The task-level evidence remains open.

The managed cold-recovery case now erases every owned source voter disk and
reopens from RustFS in both image modes. It verifies restored SQL and receipts
through a fresh quorum, resumes interrupted archive setup, and retires the old
histories. Independent voter processes and permanent Docker launch revocation
remain separate gates. The combined constrained Linux campaign at `27fde17e`
passed native and Axum SQL, leader loss, quorum refusal, archive outage,
retained maintenance and failed-voter repair in both image modes. The voters
had separate cgroups and disks in one VM. Independent process crashes during
Joint, peer activation cancellation and multi-namespace routing still need
their own qualification.

## Open case audit

The [implementation index](implementation-plan.md) records eight accepted
tasks and 120 of 163 required cases. CG-07 has a complete acceptance record
for its five public cases and all required commands at `84942c4e`.
Each remaining task still needs the exact target, case oracles and evidence
specified by `plan.py show <task>`.

| Task | Checked-in coverage | Acceptance still required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CG-09 | Five of seven exact cases pass together at `d7c3329b`. The new nine-phase controller-loss schedule interrupts observed object-store reads, reopens the original operation with fresh clients, and checks both cells' serving histories and duplicate-command versions. Earlier sealing, install/publication and retirement-pin cases pass on the same executable. The exact phase case also passes both RustFS image modes. | Qualify full effect/receiver-dedupe continuity and remote closure after erasing every local copy immediately after publication. Finish the two remaining named cases and the full task batch. Controller cancellation and joined voter restart do not replace the CG-15 process-kill matrix. |
| CG-10 | The clean operator split-and-merge case passed both RustFS image modes after retained startup moved onto a separate task and fresh commands received their own retry windows. | Qualify the named cases for exact union and adjacency, incompatible placement/durability, partial reservations across restart, writes during movement and bounded precopy. |
| CG-11 | Placement observations and advisory recommendations exist. | Qualify hysteresis, hot-cell isolation, whole-group scale out and in, failure-domain reserve and bounded controller fanout. |
| CG-12 | Two of five named cases passed in both native image modes. They cover alarm and peer wake without a client, and refusal of strong reads and quorum writes during minority wake. The constrained daemon also parks and wakes a group. | Qualify all-voter eligibility and pending-work refusal, partial/stale certificates, and the full parked restart and leader-loss case. Measure wake latency in the planned profiles. |
| CG-13 | The clean host-native recovery case passed both RustFS image modes after all owned voter disks were erased, using a fixture fence. | Qualify interrupted transition closure selection, permanent revocation of every possible old writer, fresh histories and retry under independent Docker voter processes. Exercise the outbox ambiguity refusal. |
| CG-14 | The daemon harness retains scoped real-voter/RustFS evidence. The focused native occupancy-128 case passes; the original three-occupancy matrix still times out at 128. | Build the planned harness acceptance target for real occupancies, ownership, complete ledgers, evidence drift rejection and measured profiles. |
| CG-15 | Checkpoints cover individual public faults and archive recovery. | Run the history oracle, full crash and transition matrix, archive reclamation under load, wake profiles, soak and independent-domain loss. |
| CG-16 | Public shared-group SQL has scoped coverage. The per-cell host and its seed, archive and inspection wire adapters are retired. | Audit the remaining low-level verification surface, prove full public operations and joined shutdown in all modes, and bind release evidence to one source. |

## First delivery of quorum SQL through public ingress

An explicitly configured Raft namespace defaults to three voters and a
quorum durability minimum. Public Raft commands default to quorum durability
and queries default to linearizable reads. A quorum acknowledgement requires
a committed command and its applied receipt. Explicit S3 durability waits for
archive proof. The release should define which SQL capabilities are available
through the shared backend and preserve typed refusals for the rest.

1. **Close CG-09 transition acceptance.** The planned target now passes
   five of seven required cases. Finish full effect/receiver-dedupe continuity
   and remote closure after immediate local erasure. Retain the existing three oracles
   and complete the whole acceptance batch on one source.
2. **Close CG-10 split and merge acceptance.** Qualify exact partition union,
   adjacency and policy checks, partial reservations, writes during movement
   and bounded precopy with the existing operator.
3. **Finish CG-11–13 managed operations.** Qualify adaptive placement,
   fenced hibernation and wakeup, and S3 recovery of interrupted transitions.
   Run the managed Docker fencing and complete voter-disk-loss drill. CG-13
   also requires the CG-14 infrastructure harness.
4. **Qualify and ship through CG-14–16.** Resolve the occupancy-128 matrix
   timeout without changing its original bounds. Run the mixed-load,
   reclamation, crash, partition and disk-loss matrix, including process crashes
   during Joint, peer activation cancellation and multi-namespace ingress.
   Bind the final cutover to complete release evidence.

## P0: finish the MVP and its merge gates

CG-07 has passed its five named public cases and all required commands at
`84942c4e`. Its native and constrained Linux RustFS results are recorded in
[progress](progress.md). Those accepted SQL gates are complete at their
recorded source and scope. Expanded fault, cancellation, load and combined
release qualification belongs to CG-14–16.

The performance runner retains the original 60-second enrollment budget and
five-second per-call cap. On `beeaa1b3`, the focused occupancy-128 case passed
with 45.112 seconds for enrollment and 150.69 seconds for the full data checks.
The original occupancy matrix still failed at occupancy 128 after 66 cells.
The smaller occupancies enrolled in 2.448 and 12.553 seconds. A process sample
places substantial time in blocking file synchronization. The manifest update
now uses one directory barrier while retaining every page-file barrier and
quarantining uncertain writes. These results establish scoped correctness and
an unresolved matrix gap; they do not qualify the load profiles.

Proceed with the planned CG-09 and CG-10 targets while retaining that CG-14
failure. A successful clean split and merge does not prove restart at every
phase, partial reservation handling or all required retirement pins. Preserve
the exact oracles in `tasks.json` and source-pinned acceptance records.

Local and remote request attempts must keep the same routing session,
admission and original deadline. Incoming RPCs execute locally; leader hints
and discovery supply destinations, never authority. Preserve typed refusal
and ambiguity, original receipts and physical responder observations.

The remaining RustFS disaster gate permanently fences every old writer,
erases all voter disks, and restores a new incarnation from complete S3
closure. Verify original receipts and client floors, old-process and launch
refusal, fresh quorum, new writes and retained restart in both image forms.
Local reclamation under load requires archive coverage and complete outcome
accounting. Keep loopback, process and independent-host scopes explicit.

## Source-sealing implementation boundary

The unmanaged verification directory roots an exact split or merge plan in the
range head CAS. It retains Planned, Prepared, SealAuthorized and Cancelled
metadata across owner restart. Authorization and cancellation compete on the
same prepared head. Ordinary range publication, import and disaster recovery
must acquire the topology head without an active transition. Routing continues
to select the original parent ranges until the verified transfer publishes.

The managed transition holds the fleet disruption slot from admission and
binds source seal and child installation to the exact plan and physical
replicas. The parent drains accepted proposals before committing the seal.
The child install, fresh-term quorum set and verified source archive closure
pass their focused native and real RustFS gates. Atomic publication and
replicated child activation have a focused native test that also checks
retained cell values, original receipt replay and a new quorum write on each
transferred cell. Complete the planned CG-09 target, including restart at
every phase, child archive closure and retirement pins, on one qualified
source.

The sealed-source journal accepts one explicit archive hold per planned parent.
Each hold must belong to the namespace-bound archive and independently restore
the matching replicated seal and its complete image closure. The directory
records the exact ordered set only after verification. The transition owner
retains those holds until retirement and re-verifies them after restart.

## Default backend, capabilities and deployment

An explicitly configured Raft SQL namespace uses shared groups, defaults to
quorum minimum durability and three voters, and defaults commands to quorum.
CG-07 qualifies its namespace provisioning, SDK, CLI, daemon and public ingress
at the recorded boundary. Broad default selection across all cell classes and
the final deployment cutover remain CG-16 decisions after capability coverage.
Missing quorum must refuse admission without selecting weaker durability.
The intended contract is three-replica shared groups, quorum writes and
asynchronous S3 archives, with measured archive lag/RPO. An explicit S3 write
requires its separate complete coverage proof.

Resolve the default backend's capability matrix before enabling it broadly.
Workflow/Queue callbacks, WebSockets and mutable-container behavior need equivalent
adapters or an explicit supported product scope; the native SQL counter cases
do not establish their coverage. Preserve capability refusals while these remain
unimplemented. Existing Fleet data requires a separate deployment decision:
this plan supplies no online Fleet-to-Raft conversion and must not reinterpret
old data as a new Raft history.

The shared-group SDK and counter ingress default to linearizable reads.
Callers can select a receipt-based version floor or explicitly permit stale
reads. The recorded public request cases cover these policies; the combined
release must retain their oracles independently of storage-backend selection.

## P1: complete the requested architecture

These are required follow-ups, not removed scope or optional substitutes for the
full hard cutover.

| Task | Deliverable and dependency |
| --- | --- |
| CG-09 | Irreversible source sealing and whole-cell transfer, with cancellation/seal serialization, quorum installation and atomic range publication. Preserve cell histories, receipts, effect IDs and remote recovery closure. |
| CG-10 | Split hot groups and merge compatible adjacent ranges using CG-09; recover partially completed transitions without reopening a sealed source. |
| CG-11 | Group placement, failure-domain/reserve accounting, load observations, hysteresis and hot-cell isolation over the same transition/membership owners. |
| CG-12 | Fenced group parking and authority-checked wakeup. Resume actual membership/quorum under the original request deadline; measure cold response latency rather than assuming immediate readiness. |
| CG-13 | Managed S3 recovery of complete groups and incomplete transfers/splits/merges, including zero-quorum fencing, fresh incarnations and unfinished lifecycle journals. |
| CG-14 | Reproducible process/RustFS harnesses with real independent cells/groups, source/binary/profile hashes, owned resources and complete outcome ledgers. |
| CG-15 | Full load/crash, transition, wakeup and disaster-recovery matrix. Measure the documented profiles and failure schedules; no capacity or TiKV performance-parity claim follows from correctness tests. |
| CG-16 | Delete remaining predecessor consumers/codecs, finish feature-off/full release checks, publish the unified API/runbooks and qualified operating envelope. No one-cell special path, compatibility reader or production mode toggle. |
