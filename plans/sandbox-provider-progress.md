# Sandbox provider implementation ledger

Objective: deliver the full
[sandbox provider and compatibility plan](sandbox-provider-compatibility.md),
including local published Cloudflare package compatibility, portable four-language
controls, the named remote providers, lifetime/fencing/reconciliation behavior,
and the plan's live and fault qualification. This ledger records progress; it
does not narrow that objective or turn fixture passes into full compatibility.

## Requirement audit

| Slice | Current evidence | Remaining work / completion evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SP-01 | Exact celld reference commit/files/license, npm packages/lock/integrities, imported runtime bytes and immutable Sandbox image manifest are in `tools/sandbox/compat`; drift/refusal tests pass; API/fixture inventory lists native mappings and explicit gaps | Input inventory implemented; runtime conformance remains in SP-02–SP-04 and later profiles |
| SP-02 | Native-backed DO SQL/KV/clone facade, activation-bound authority, object identity, constructor admission and scheduling primitives execute in Node/V8; actual published constructors are exercised | Complete module/bootstrap/web globals, namespace bindings/RPC, native critical-section/reset/lifetime behavior, transactions and profile/version admission; retain native-only dependency boundary |
| SP-03 | Actual published `@cloudflare/containers@0.3.7` constructor, state and SQL scheduling run in both engines with native storage and a stopped-provider view; unchanged upstream example is pinned | Execute the unchanged app, class hooks, routing, sleep/wake, process/port behavior and cleanup against the native engine |
| SP-04 | Actual `@cloudflare/sandbox@0.12.9` constructor/configuration and metadata recovery run in Node; matching upstream app/Dockerfile and `linux/amd64` image digest are pinned | Run the unchanged app and SDK/image end to end over HTTP and RPC; files, streamed exec, background records, previews, teardown and failure cases |
| SP-05 | Provider environment/operation/limit discovery is implemented in Rust, Python, JS and TS; native and restricted provider dispatch tests cover it | Portable files and richer operations, named configuration, durable remote bindings, fencing, expiry/reconnect, loss/unknown outcomes and orphan reconciliation |
| SP-06 | No Vercel/E2B implementation yet | Real shared provider implementations, fixtures and real-account conformance, explicit Cloudflare profile compatibility/gaps |
| SP-07 | Separate 1.x contract identified in the design; it is not the 0.12.9 baseline | Pin and run exact current package/helper/image, extended container API, errors, streams, cancellation and supported persistence |
| SP-08 | No Daytona/Modal implementation yet | Provider implementations and individual process/files/storage/PTY/GPU/snapshot qualification |
| SP-09 | No Dynamic Worker or hosted Cloudflare provider yet | Actual isolate loader/limits/capability isolation; optional authenticated hosted gateway, outbound policy and cleanup qualification |
| SP-10 | Initial input manifest explicitly reports `conformance: not_run` | Publish operation/version compatibility results only after actual four-language, lifecycle, fault, resource, fencing and shutdown qualification |

## Verified implementation details

### Provider capability discovery

`cellar-container::Adapter::capabilities` describes host configuration without
creating a session or contacting an engine. Invocation-owned
`container.capabilities` is provided by the shared boundary, including for a
restricted provider that does not implement that operation itself. It requires
root-cell event authority and never reaches the provider's effect dispatcher.

The version-1 descriptor contains provider name, explicit execution environment,
actually supported operations, host body limit and the provider's declared
handle limit. Existing custom providers default to `unspecified` environment
and an unknown handle limit, rather than claiming Linux or unlimited resources.
Native declares Linux and its enforced 64-handle limit. Future snapshot, PTY or
isolate features are not advertised before their operations exist.

Python exposes an immutable dataclass/tuple; JS exposes a frozen descriptor and
operation list; TS declarations preserve readonly fields. This is a partial
SP-05 delivery, not a remote provider or compatibility implementation.

### Published input audit

The pinned Containers package executes synchronous Durable Object SQL from its
constructor and alarm scheduling and uses synchronous `storage.kv`. The Sandbox
package additionally imports Workers RPC/tracing and uses storage transactions
and the real Cap'n Web transport. Replacing SQL cursors with empty arrays or
rewriting package APIs is not acceptable conformance evidence.

The native operation boundary now has a bounded, invocation-owned synchronous
path for the optional compatibility runtime. SDK operations still execute in
the original native turn with the same operation/value budgets, effect
classification, epoch checks and cancellation. No language runtime thread
operates cell SQLite. A finite allowlist excludes external/network/container
I/O from synchronous calls. V8 waits on a private reply channel; Node's private
I/O worker wakes a bounded shared buffer and accounts queued messages against
one shared byte limit. The application event-loop watchdog still applies.

Both backends pass real-node SQL/KV mutation and fresh-runtime restart tests,
including cell isolation, saved-context refusal, asynchronous/synchronous
mutation conflicts, alarm reads and pre-effect refusal of synchronous external
calls. Runtime tests cover operation exhaustion, unsafe post-mutation replies,
cancellation with subsequent runtime reuse, and joined shutdown without a reply.
The follow-up now adds the actual SQL/KV facade and constructor-admission
slice described below. Module/DO RPC dispatch and complete native critical
section/transaction/lifetime semantics remain required.

### Native-backed Workers storage and activation slice

`packages/cellar-cloudflare` owns the optional module/storage/activation facade.
SQL uses real lazy native cursors with typed blobs, explicit JS numeric
conversion, shared raw/object iteration, counters and size. Handle count and
retained Rust payload bytes are bounded; post-step/result/quota failures remain
unknown outcomes. Cursor release frees quota and cancellation/drop schedules
native cleanup. SQLite VM/page-cache/RSS limits are a separate qualification.

KV uses the existing engine-free persisted-clone codec, with serialization only
inside Node/V8. Cycles, shared binary backing stores, bigint, dates, maps/sets,
errors, sparse arrays and lone UTF-16 value strings survive round trips and
runtime restart. Unsupported RPC/delegate capabilities fail instead of becoming
empty objects. Batches validate/decode before writes, limit aggregate clone
bytes, and protect host-private key access. List iteration jumps the reserved
range in either direction without consuming the visible limit.

A private activation getter reuses only the current continuation's exact native
object token and checks invocation/owner liveness. The Rust host independently
binds resources to `InvocationAuthority`; the container provider authority now
reuses that exact invocation/facet check. Tests cover foreign cells, saved event
contexts/cursors, idle eviction with a new epoch, and instance replacement at the
same epoch. Native identity and V8 random/UUID scheduling paths are implemented.

Published Containers 0.3.7 construction/state/scheduling and Sandbox 0.12.9
construction/configuration/metadata recovery execute through real native nodes.
The fixtures observe a stopped configured provider and intentionally supply no
start/monitor/port methods. They do not run the unchanged upstream apps or the
Sandbox image. Shared initialization is memoized in the fixture adapter so an
alarm and fetch cannot construct duplicate objects for one activation.

Constructor callbacks remain attached to their original event, and local
admission refuses failed initialization, including rejection with `undefined`.
This is not yet the complete native input-gate/reset/30-second contract.
`Context::block_concurrency_while`, `Context::wait_until`, native transactions
and `Invocation::CellRpc` already exist and must be used by the final dispatch
protocol. Do not replace them with detached JS work, guessed rollback or an
HTTP-only RPC substitute. Module/bootstrap globals, namespace bindings, RPC
objects, transactions and full container lifecycle remain SP-02/SP-03 work.

## Reproduction commands

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts --prefix tools/sandbox/compat
npm run inventory --prefix tools/sandbox/compat
npm test --prefix tools/sandbox/compat
node tools/sandbox/compat/build.mjs
npm test --prefix tools/javascript
python3 tools/python/test_encoding.py
```

The full affected Rust command is:

```sh
cargo test --locked -p cellar-container -p cellar-guest -p cellar-javascript -p cellar-python \
  --features cellar-python/embed,cellar-javascript/embed,cellar-javascript/node
cargo test --locked -p cellar-javascript --no-default-features --features node --lib
```

Native builds use the checkout's existing target directory on the workspace
volume and the repository's documented Rust/Python prerequisites. The current
main branch also needs `npm ci --ignore-scripts --prefix examples/streaming` and
`npm run --prefix examples/streaming build` before Cargo builds the embedded
streaming example.

Checkpoint `37d53cf6` passed 81 Rust harness/doc cases plus the
standalone CPython bridge, startup and live streaming programs. Four unrelated
fleet-package/documentation cases remain explicitly ignored by their harnesses.
The bridge program includes container controls, owner/crash recovery, alarm
recovery, fault/output gates and joined shutdown. The isolated CPython container
scenario also passes. Node-only library tests pass 13 cases. Published input
checks pass four tests; JS/build/type checks pass eight; Python encoding passes
12. A final repeat of the JS library and synchronous restart tests passes 24
cases after tightening the post-reply authority/allocation guards.

Strict affected-crate and Node-only Clippy, Rust formatting/module layout (918
files), documentation references, new fixture/plan links and whitespace checks
pass. The all-feature native-only dependency guard reports 455 packages with no
JavaScript engine. An initial wider run hit the existing 250 ms V8 fixture
deadline; it passed again with that deadline unchanged. The Node npm example
also required rebuilding its ignored output before the wider run. Hosted CI,
real provider accounts and actual Cloudflare package/image conformance remain
separate qualification; none is claimed here.

The new slice passes 615 Rust harness cases after merging main's Raft image
limit update (`7b38f670`) without conflicts. The checks run across the native core and affected
container/guest/JS/Python libraries and selected integrations, plus standalone
CPython streaming and isolated container programs. This includes five real-node
Worker/constructor tests (Sandbox constructor in Node), 23 JS runtime tests,
SQL buffer/handle quotas and same-epoch instance replacement. A final rerun of
the five runtime fixtures after clone-brand changes also passes. Node-only
qualification passes 14 library cases and three runtime fixtures.

Strict native/affected-crate all-target Clippy and Node-only Clippy pass. Rust
formatting/layout checks cover 927 files. Published input tests (four), JS/build/
type tests (eight), documentation/fixture links and whitespace checks pass. The
native-only all-feature dependency guard still reports 455 packages with no JS
engine. Hosted CI and all remaining SDK/image/cloud qualification remain separate.
The full SP-01–SP-10 objective stays active.
