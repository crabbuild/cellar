# Cellar multi-Raft delivery package

Status: implementation in progress. MR-01 through MR-06 are complete with
recorded evidence; MR-07 is in progress. Shared log storage, the multi-group
Raft driver, authenticated bounded TLS peer transport, verified immutable
SQLite/LTX images and private command/receipt mechanics are implemented.
SDK command/query serving, snapshot integration and S3 archive/restore remain
pending. See [task status](tasks.json), [MR-01 evidence](evidence/MR-01.json),
[MR-02 evidence](evidence/MR-02.json), [MR-03 evidence](evidence/MR-03.json),
[MR-04 evidence](evidence/MR-04.json), [MR-05 evidence](evidence/MR-05.json)
and [MR-06 evidence](evidence/MR-06.json).
Partial [MR-07 catalog evidence](evidence/MR-07-catalog-progress.json) covers
immutable namespace/birth records and permanent initial-member claims. Embedded
Raft infrastructure starts parked pending verified admission; SDK/actor command
integration and the public example remain in progress.
Partial [MR-07 registration/lifecycle evidence](evidence/MR-07-registration-progress.json)
covers the restricted SDK definitions, registered execution/query bridge and
pure command core. The node-owned scheduler, public handles and ingress are
still required.
The reviewed source baseline is `78dd39ab2b98d19672e9cf7b2b48e9fdc810ff96`.

Build a storage mode in which each cell has a three-voter Raft group, leaders
execute commands, replicas serve explicit queries, LTX carries physical SQLite
changes, and S3 archives committed history. A node leads some groups and follows
others. Majority commits replace the current all-follower proof for this mode.

## Deliverables

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Technical design](technical-design.md) | Authority, commit, storage, read, archive and recovery protocols |
| [Implementation plan](implementation-plan.md) | Ordered work packages, source ownership, deliverables and stop conditions |
| [Qualification plan](qualification.md) | Failure scenarios, correctness oracle, performance methodology and release gates |
| [Scaling plan](scaling.md) | Group density, hundreds/thousands of nodes, millions of cells and federation |
| [Application contract](application-contract.md) | Command/query registration, receipts, versions, effects and compatibility |
| [Task manifest](tasks.json) | Dependencies, test cases, command argument vectors and completion evidence |
| [Source baseline](baseline.json) | Source hashes for drift detection |
| [Capacity profiles](capacity-profiles.json) | Explicitly hypothetical scale scenarios |
| [Plan tool](plan.py) | Validate the package, inspect ready work and calculate placement arithmetic |

## Start implementation

Use a complete checkout at the baseline or a reviewed successor. Python 3.10+
and Git are sufficient for the package checks; runtime implementation uses the
repository toolchain and build instructions.

```sh
python3 plans/multi-raft/plan.py validate
python3 plans/multi-raft/plan.py preflight
python3 plans/multi-raft/plan.py ready
python3 plans/multi-raft/plan.py show MR-01
python3 -m unittest discover -s plans/multi-raft -p 'test_*.py'
```

`validate` checks document links, source paths, task dependencies, case ownership,
commands and evidence requirements. `preflight` compares the pinned source
hashes with the checkout and fails on drift. It does not rewrite the baseline.
Review every reported change, revise affected contracts and refresh the baseline
in the same reviewed change before starting dependent work.

`show` prints a task's implementation requirements and future verification
commands. It does not execute shell text, modify source, install dependencies or
mark work complete. The task commands become runnable as their targets are
implemented. The manifest records required test names, so an empty test target
or a filter that runs zero cases cannot count as completion.

Update task status manually after its evidence is recorded. DONE requires all
dependencies DONE, all named tests present and passing, and a linked evidence
record with source revision, commands, outcomes and limitations. BLOCKED describes
an implementation prerequisite, not an instruction to bypass safety.

## Decisions to implement

- One cell per group, three durable voters; optional learners for additional reads.
- `raft` 0.7.0 consensus core and `raft-engine` 0.4.2 as the selected log-engine
  integration baseline, subject to MR-02 compile, filesystem and crash gates.
- Shared node runtime, transport and log engine; no per-cell thread or log engine.
- Private leader execution state; only committed, crash-consistent SQLite
  generations can serve queries or establish successful command results.
- One outstanding data proposal per cell in the first release.
- Quorum durability by default in the new mode, with explicit S3-durable requests.
- Stale, minimum-version and safe ReadIndex linearizable queries.
- Raft owns leadership and membership. No bucket-only fallback after quorum loss.
- An isolated namespace and storage prefix with immutable mode selection.
  Cells in Fleet mode retain their current authority protocol.
- Automatic replica repair and balanced placement are first-release requirements.
- Small materialized databases first. Shared-cell groups, Raft hibernation,
  page-versioned execution and federation are separate scaling milestones.

## Delivery boundary

MR-01 through MR-15 deliver and qualify the first release. MR-16 and MR-17 are
later scaling work, with their own release evidence. Hundreds/thousands of nodes
and millions of logical cells are qualification targets, not established limits.
Millions of physical nodes require federation and are not a single-cluster promise.

The earlier `codex/read-replica-design` proposal preserves the Fleet ownership
protocol and treats read copies as disposable caches. This proposal instead
introduces consensus-backed authority and durable voting replicas. Reuse its
query isolation ideas where useful; it is not a prerequisite branch and this
package contains the required contracts independently.

The [storage integration audit](storage-integration.md) records the host filesystem
adaptation required by MR-02.

## Validation record

Package integrity and negative checker tests are recorded in
[validation](validation.md). These checks do not establish Raft safety, runtime
performance, or deployment qualification. Runtime evidence belongs to the work
packages and [qualification gates](qualification.md).
