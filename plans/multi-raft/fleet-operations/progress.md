# Fleet operations implementation progress

The full fleet operations goal is active. FO-01 is implemented at the catalog
adapter boundary. FO-02 through FO-10 remain pending; the operator commands,
automatic redistribution, managed maintenance and resize workflows are not yet
available. The task manifest is authoritative for package status and retained
completion records.

## Implemented catalog foundation

Source `4832486df3eff29ab3b5ed61f572513e59b37828` adds the private
`crates/cellar/durability/raft/fleet_catalog/` component and an unstable verification
export. Production host/controller integration follows in the remaining packages.

- All root changes use the existing no-hidden-retry `Bucket::put_cas` adapter.
- A genesis pin prevents silently recreating an initialized fleet after root loss.
- Five immutable indexes hold policy, nodes, histories, operation projections and
  admission projections. A separate permanent mutation journal records exact
  request digests and original applied revisions.
- Lost responses can be reconciled by a fresh adapter after later revisions.
  Repeated mutation identity with different payload is refused.
- Hash-radix pages use at most 64 KiB, 128 leaf entries and a bounded depth of 16.
  Snapshot-bound cursors avoid bucket listing and preserve historical reads.
- Root, request, record, page, key and batch sizes are bounded. One admitted
  catalog turn per shared adapter supplies immediate backpressure and bounded
  index-path memory. Attempts use the execution-domain deadline and refuse a
  closed domain.

The adapter stores atomic metadata projections; it does not decide whether an
operator state transition is legal or authorize a membership change. Typed
membership/lifecycle decisions and proof checks belong to FO-02 through FO-09.
The raw projection tests establish CAS atomicity and referencing behavior, not
an end-user evacuation certificate. No business write-acknowledgement path calls
this component yet.

## Completed verification

On macOS arm64 with Rust 1.98.1 and a checkout-specific target:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `native_raft_fleet_catalog` | 11 passed, including competing writers, lost replies, stale request identity, orphan metadata, invalid records, pagination, cancellation, backpressure and closed-domain refusal |
| `native_raft_directory` | 16 existing native cases passed, including node identity, process refresh, inspection, cached quorum routes and joined shutdown |
| Focused Clippy | Passed with `-D warnings`; existing third-party Raft warnings remain outside the changed code |
| Rust formatting and module layout | Passed |
| Native dependency check | 454 reachable packages, no JavaScript engine |
| Documentation checks | Passed |
| Plan validator tests | 10 passed |

Logs, executable digest, source identity and the FO-01 completion record are
retained under ignored `.cellar/raft-perf/fleet-operations/implementation/fo01/`.
Initial fixture and test-harness failures are retained separately. No raw evidence
was added under `plans/multi-raft/evidence/`. A fresh checkout must restore retained
artifacts before auditing a DONE record; missing logs are not treated as a pass.

These results qualify local conditional in-memory storage and native directory
regressions. Physical RustFS semantics, five/six-node operation, performance,
failure/recovery histories and the 24-hour soak remain FO-10 gates.

## Next implementation boundary

FO-02 must persist a consumed permit sequence and exact active permit binding
with each group's membership state. It must guard ordinary/managed configuration
ingress, commit an unused-permit cancellation fence before releasing reservations,
retain both-majority joint recovery, and preserve the guard through snapshots and
archives. It must not use an object-store observation or RPC acceptance as quorum
proof. Subsequent packages retain their complete design and acceptance scope.
